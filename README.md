# Prontuario_Medico
The project is a medical record system developed in C# using the .NET Framework. The main objective of the system is to allow the storage and management of information related to patients, their medical histories, exams, previous appointments, vaccinations, allergies, procedures, and medical prescriptions.

The system follows an object-oriented approach, with the creation of specific classes for each option in the medical record menu. Each class represents an entity or category of information, such as medical history, exams, appointments, and others.

For each class, properties are defined to represent relevant data fields. For example, the "Medical History" class may have properties like name, age, height, weight, and health history. Similarly, other classes would have appropriate properties to store specific information.

Additionally, the system provides functionalities such as record inclusion, deletion, search, and modification, enabling interaction with the stored data. It also implements the capability to save and read data in XML format, ensuring persistence and portability of the medical records.

The system's interface is designed intuitively, with a side menu that allows accessing different sections, and a main panel that displays editable fields corresponding to the selected information. The system can also be extended with additional features, such as a general listing in DataGrid or TextBox, to facilitate data visualization and manipulation.

Overall, the project aims to provide an efficient and organized software solution for medical record management, promoting secure storage and quick access to relevant patient information.
